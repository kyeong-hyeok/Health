  <h2>Health Training</h2>
  Movement is the most natural activity to keep body in its best efficiency or to regain the best conditions of functionality of the muscular and cardiovascular system after a period of inactivity or immobility caused by an illness or injury.
  Walking and running, carried out in a planned and repetitive way, start up a series of physiological responses that, if organized in a planned way, undoubtedly lead to an organic strengthening of all devices that are involved and interrupt the process of slow degeneration caused by the lack of long-term physical activity.
